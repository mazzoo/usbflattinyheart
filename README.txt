~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A USB device moving your mouse in a heart shape.

As hardware I use a usbflattiny which a friend designed and sent me:

It's an Atmel ATtiny45 connected to USB, meant to be running the
device USB stack in software.

As software I use V-USB, an opensource USB stack:

Their (mainly) opensource license applies, see
OBJECTIVE_DEVELOPMENT_GmbH_license.txt

A cummulated screenshot of my development through the day can be seen in
